# Polynomial-Multiplier-Assembly-Mips32

In q4-2.asm, writes a subroutine that multiplies two polynomials with integer coefficients and returns the degree of the resulting polynomials and coefficients.

In q6-2.asm, writes a program that takes two signed 32-bit numbers from the user and multiplies them with the help of shifts and successive additions.
(Assumes that the product will not exceed 32 bits.)

In q6-3.asm, writes a subroutine that returns the square root of a positive decimal number by using the algorithm below.

r=1
while (|r*r-x|>eps)
r=(r+x/r)/2
